# Instructions

1. Familiarize yourself with the provided utilities and helpers, like `listSum(..)`, `listProduct(..)`, `mapObj(..)`, etc.

2. Find the `// TODO` comments and implement both `filterObj(..)` and `reduceObj(..)`. The fixed exercise should now print `38886` to the console.

3. Recall/review the following topics:
	- argument manipulation (`binary(..)`)
	- point-free style
	- composition (`compose(..)`, `pipe(..)`)
	- currying
	- list operations (`reduce(..)`)

4. Using only the provided utilities in this exercise, refactor the three separate statements that invoke `mapObj(..)`, `filterObj(..)`, and `reduceObj(..)` into a single list operation that's completely point-free. Hint: `reduce(..)` and `pipe(..)`.
